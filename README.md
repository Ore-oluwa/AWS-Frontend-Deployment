# AWS-Frontend-Deployment
 I designed an Architectural flow Diagram that includes a React app hosted on Amazon S3 ( for static website hosting), Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, Amazon Route 53 for domain/DNS management, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for HTTPS, using AWS architecture icons. I also added CI/CD with GitHub Actions for S3 deployment.
